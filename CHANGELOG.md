## [0.6.2] — 2026-05-14

### Added
- **`disable-model-invocation: true` on 3 side-effect skills** — `release`, `finishing-branch`, `framework-management` now require explicit user invocation (typed `/release`, `/finishing-branch`, `/framework-management`). Prevents the LLM from auto-triggering side-effect or framework-mutating skills based on description-match alone.
- **`user-invocable: false` on `using-skills`** — meta-skill is hidden from the `/` menu (LLM still loads it; users have no reason to type `/using-skills`).
- **`argument-hint` on 3 skills** — `vibe` (`[idea-or-status-or-reset-or-auto]`), `brainstorm` (`[idea]`), `release` (`[version]`). Improves `/skill <args>` autocomplete UX.
- **Anthropic `!`<command>`` dynamic context injection in `vibe` Phase 1** — current branch, git status, recent artifacts (latest spec/plan/evaluation/release) pre-resolved at skill-load time. Saves 1 Bash round-trip per `/vibe` invocation. Phase 1 still links to `reference/stage-detection.md` for the full session-aware bash; the auto-inject covers the high-signal subset.
- **`npm run test:generators`** — multi-occurrence first-occurrence-only regression test. New `lib/templates/multi-occurrence-fixture.md.tmpl` has 2× `{{PREAMBLE_CORE}}` (canonical + code-fenced); `lib/test-generators.js` asserts that all 3 generators (js / sh / ps1) expand only the canonical occurrence (signature: exactly 1 `**Status protocol**` in output). Catches the v0.6.1 ps1 `[regex]::Replace(..., MatchEvaluator, count=1)` silent-failure regression class. Wired into `verify:skill-docs` umbrella.
- **CRLF advisory in `lib/check-skill-docs.js`** — warns (stderr-only) if any committed `skills/**/SKILL.md` contains `\r\n`, indicating someone bypassed `npm run gen-skills` after a manual edit. Defense-in-depth on top of v0.6.1's `.gitattributes` LF-pin.

### Changed
- **`lib/validate-skills.sh` Iron Law examples check upgraded** — passes if EITHER inline example fences exist OR a `reference/<topic>.md` file exists. Fixes the post-v0.6.1 false positive on `test-driven-development` (which moved its Good/Bad examples to `reference/red-green-refactor.md`).
- **`lib/check-workflow-contract.js` REFLECT gate** — now accepts `release-*.md` (which since v0.5.8 contains the `## Retrospective` section per the `self-improvement` skill's "retro merged into release" convention) as fulfilling the gate. Standalone `improvement-*.md` is still accepted. Removes the false error on v0.6.1's `main-skill-layering-anthropic` flow.
- **`skills/using-skills/SKILL.md` line endings** — normalized from CRLF to LF (caught by the new CRLF advisory while testing it).

### Deferred (v0.7.0+ backlog)
- `context: fork` + `agent:` migration for the 7 dispatch-agent skills.
- `!`<command>`` dynamic context injection in `verification` / `release` (extension of v0.6.2's vibe-only adoption).
- `$ARGUMENTS` / `$N` substitution (depends on argument-hint signal first).
- `model:` / `effort:` per-skill overrides.
- `paths` glob auto-trigger review (probably not applicable).

## [0.6.1] — 2026-05-14

### Added
- **`reference/<topic>.md` supporting-files convention** — Anthropic's progressive-disclosure pattern adopted as the single project-wide rule. Long reference material now lives at `skills/<name>/reference/<topic>.md` (subdirectory always; flat `reference.md` at skill root is non-conforming). Documented canonically in `framework-management` skill § Supporting Files.
- **11 new `reference/<topic>.md` files** across 5 trimmed skills (`self-improvement`, `vibe`, `subagent-development`, `frontend-design`, `test-driven-development`) and `framework-management` itself (eat-our-own-dogfood pointer).
- **`${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` runtime token** — generators preserve the literal token in generated `SKILL.md`; Anthropic's skill runtime resolves it at load time. Used in 15 cross-skill link URLs across the 5 trimmed skills for plugin-portable references.
- **Golden-fixture parity check (`npm run verify:fixture-parity`)** — closes v0.6.0 retro ACTION 1. `lib/templates/fixture.md.tmpl` exercises every substitution token; `lib/verify-fixture-parity.js` runs all 3 generators (js / sh / ps1) and asserts byte-identical output via `sha256` triple-equality. Wired into the `verify:skill-docs` umbrella script.
- **Two advisory warnings in `lib/check-skill-docs.js`** — (1) `SKILL.md.tmpl ≥ 300 lines && no reference/ subdir`, (2) any flat `skills/<name>/reference.md` at skill root. Both are stderr-only and never fail CI; they're authoring nudges. `framework-management` skip-listed because it documents the rules literally.
- **`.gitattributes` LF lock** — `skills/**/SKILL.md`, `skills/**/SKILL.md.tmpl`, `skills/**/reference/*.md`, `lib/templates/*.tmpl`, `lib/templates/*.md`, `lib/preamble*.md` all pinned to LF line endings so cross-platform `sha256sum` parity holds regardless of `core.autocrlf` settings.

### Changed
- **5 longest skill bodies trimmed** by extracting reference material into `reference/<topic>.md`:
  - `self-improvement` 421 → 270 lines (-151) — Phases 0/3/6/7 templates + final block extracted to `reference/phase-templates.md`.
  - `vibe` 382 → 275 lines (-107) — Phase 1 detection bash + dispatch-brief table extracted to `reference/stage-detection.md` and `reference/dispatch-brief.md`.
  - `subagent-development` 356 → 213 lines (-143) — Wave Planning, Consensus Protocol, and report templates extracted to `reference/wave-planning.md`, `reference/consensus-protocol.md`, `reference/report-templates.md`.
  - `frontend-design` 338 → 248 lines (-90) — Quality Gate scoring rubric and Steering Command Protocol extracted to `reference/quality-gate.md` and `reference/reference-loading.md` (alongside existing 9 design-principle siblings + `design-md-library/`, all unchanged).
  - `test-driven-development` 316 → 205 lines (-111) — Iron Law worked examples + anti-patterns table + test organization extracted to `reference/red-green-refactor.md` and `reference/anti-patterns.md`.
- **Total `SKILL.md` body lines: 6,793 → 6,181 (-612 lines, -9%)** — recurring per-session token cost reduced ~30% on the 5 worst-offender skills, freeing ~6k tokens of Anthropic's 25k cross-skill re-attach budget for `/vibe auto` runs.
- **`framework-management/SKILL.md`** — added new § Supporting Files (with own `reference/supporting-files.md` for full convention details). Body net +13 lines.
- **`using-skills/SKILL.md`** — 1-line pointer added to the Document Output Convention section, directing skill authors to framework-management § Supporting Files.
- **Cross-platform generator parity hardened** — all 3 generators (`lib/gen-skill-docs.{js,sh,ps1}`) and `lib/check-skill-docs.js` now normalize CRLF/CR → LF on read and strip trailing newlines on write. `gen-skill-docs.ps1` Expand-Token rewritten to use `IndexOf` + `Substring` (the prior `[regex]::Replace(..., MatchEvaluator, count=1)` silently ignored the count argument with the evaluator overload).

### Deferred (v4 backlog, user pre-authorized)
- `disable-model-invocation: true` on `release` / `finishing-branch` / `framework-management`.
- `user-invocable: false` on `using-skills`.
- `context: fork` + `agent:` migration for the 7 dispatch-agent skills.
- `!`<command>`` dynamic context injection in `vibe` / `verification` / `release`.
- `argument-hint` / `$ARGUMENTS` field adoption.
- `paths` glob auto-trigger review.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-05-13

### Added
- **`/vibe auto` subcommand** — single-command end-to-end pipeline. Chains `brainstorm → writing-plans → plan-review → executing-plans → code-review → qa → verification → release` with only the THINK spec-approval human gate. Documented in `commands/vibe.md` + new mode section in `skills/vibe/SKILL.md` Phase 3. See flow diagram and "when NOT to use" guidance in `commands/vibe.md`.
- **2-tier preamble (progressive disclosure)** — `lib/preamble-core.md` (15 lines, inlined into every SKILL.md via `{{PREAMBLE_CORE}}`) + `lib/preamble-ref.md` (127 lines, loaded on demand via `{{PREAMBLE_REF_LINK}}` markdown link). Matches Anthropic's official skill guideline: skill body loads only when invoked, long reference loads on demand. Legacy `{{PREAMBLE}}` kept as deprecated alias with build-time warning.
- **Canonical frontmatter fields on all 28 skills** — every skill now declares `when_to_use`, `produces`, `consumes`, optional `dispatch-agent`. All 28 frontmatters parse as valid YAML. Enables machine-checkable stage linkage.
- **Produces/consumes linkage validation** — `lib/check-workflow-contract.js` gained Section 1: builds a graph of `produces` → `consumes` across all skills and fails when a `consumes` target matches no `produces` pattern. Legacy sessions predating `20260513` are exempted via `CONTRACT_CUTOFF_YYYYMMDD` constant.
- **`agents/explorer.md`** — new read-only isolated-context exploration agent. Tools: Read / Grep / Glob / safe read-only Bash. Dispatched by `investigate`, `systematic-debugging` (debug evidence), and `executing-plans` (cross-file surveys on ≥5-step waves). Absorbs the Phase-2 evidence-gathering role of the retired `debugger` agent.
- **`lib/frontmatter-map.json` + `lib/apply-frontmatter.js`** — tooling used during the v0.6.0 migration to rewrite frontmatter consistently across 28 skills. Block-scalar YAML form used for descriptions containing `:` / `→` / quotes to avoid parse errors.

### Changed
- **Agent consolidation: 11 → 5.** `planner-reviewer` (renamed from `architect`) absorbs the retired `planner`, `ceo-advisor`, `evaluator`, `security-auditor`, `code-reviewer` agents via mode selector (planning / strategy / engineering / evaluation / security / code-review). `frontend-designer` (renamed from `designer`). `explorer` (new). `refactoring-agent` and `doc-writer` unchanged. Surviving 5 agents all have ≥ 4 skill dispatchers (fan-in).
- **Pipeline stage→agent routing** in `skills/vibe/SKILL.md` fully remapped to the 5 canonical agents. All 13 skill bodies that referenced retired agent names were updated (exception: `debugger` as JS keyword in lint-grep patterns is preserved in `code-review`/`verification`/`finishing-branch`).
- **Cross-platform generator parity enforced** — `lib/gen-skill-docs.{js,sh,ps1}` normalized to strip a single trailing newline from preamble content before token interpolation. Verified byte-identical output across all three generators on a `brainstorm` fixture.
- **`skills/workflow/SKILL.md` demoted to 50-line stub** — operational pipeline logic now lives in exactly two places (`vibe` runtime + `using-skills` routing). Body is a pointer table to `/vibe auto`, `using-skills` Quick Reference, and `check:workflow-contract`. Eliminates prior 3-way drift between workflow/vibe/using-skills descriptions.
- **Trigger-conflict disambiguation** in `CLAUDE.md` — sharpened trigger column for 5 conflict pairs: `executing-plans` vs `test-driven-development`, `code-review` vs `plan-review`, `workflow` vs `vibe`, `release` vs `ship`, `refactoring` vs `code-review`.
- **`lib/validate-skills.sh`** updated to accept either `{{PREAMBLE_CORE}}` + `{{PREAMBLE_REF_LINK}}` (new, canonical) or `{{PREAMBLE}}` (legacy, deprecated warning). SKILL.md expansion check now accepts either the new `Preamble (Core)` marker or the legacy `Completion Status Protocol` header.
- **`framework-management/SKILL.md.tmpl`** — scaffolding example now teaches the new 2-token pattern and the 3 required frontmatter fields (`when_to_use`, `produces`, `consumes`). Newly-authored skills inherit the progressive-disclosure convention from day one.
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — added "Agents Available" table between the Skills and Commands sections, describing the 5 canonical agents + their dispatchers.

### Removed
- **7 retired agent files**: `ceo-advisor.md`, `code-reviewer.md`, `debugger.md`, `evaluator.md`, `planner.md`, `security-auditor.md`, `test-writer.md`. Each agent's unique content was absorbed into its parallel skill before deletion (zero knowledge loss). History preserved in git; `git show <old-commit>:agents/X.md` still works.

### Migration notes

**If you have your own skills or scripts that reference retired agent names, remap as follows:**

| Retired agent | Replacement | Notes |
|---------------|-------------|-------|
| `planner` | `planner-reviewer` (planning mode) | Mode specified in dispatch prompt |
| `architect` | `planner-reviewer` (engineering mode) | Renamed |
| `ceo-advisor` | `planner-reviewer` (strategy mode) | Absorbed |
| `evaluator` | `planner-reviewer` (evaluation mode) OR `verification` skill | Most use cases covered by `verification` in main context |
| `code-reviewer` | `planner-reviewer` (code-review mode) | Absorbed |
| `security-auditor` | `planner-reviewer` (security audit mode) | Absorbed; dependency sub-mode for OWASP A06 |
| `test-writer` | `test-driven-development` skill | No longer an agent — runs in main context |
| `debugger` | `explorer` (Phase-2 evidence) OR `systematic-debugging` skill | Debug protocol moved into skill; `explorer` provides isolated-context survey |
| `designer` | `frontend-designer` | Renamed; same responsibilities |

**If you copy `SKILL.md.tmpl` patterns from this repo:**
Replace `{{PREAMBLE}}` with `{{PREAMBLE_CORE}}` + `{{PREAMBLE_REF_LINK}}`. The legacy token still works but emits a build-time warning.

### Results

- 9,947 → 6,793 skill lines (−3,154, −31.7 %)
- 4 → 0 skills over Anthropic's 500-line guideline
- 11 → 5 agents (−54 %)
- 0/28 → 28/28 frontmatter coverage on `when_to_use` / `produces` / `consumes`
- New CI invariant: `gen-skill-docs.{js,sh,ps1}` produce byte-identical output
- New CI invariant: `consumes` must resolve to some skill's `produces`

---

## [0.5.9] — 2026-05-07

### Added
- **Unified KPI schema** — new `docs/superomni/style-profiles/evaluation-kpi-schema.md` defining 6 measurement dimensions: gate pass rate, evaluation coverage, agent performance score, skill effectiveness score, Iron Law compliance rate, and context efficiency (preamble size).
- **Missing output directories** — bootstrapped `docs/superomni/{evaluations,improvements,releases,harness-audits,reviews,executions,subagents,production-readiness}/` with `.gitkeep` so all artifact paths exist before any skill writes to them.

### Changed
- **`lib/check-workflow-contract.js`** — extended artifact recognition: `release` and `harness-audit` types now parsed; date pattern updated to accept both `YYYYMMDD` (session artifacts) and `YYYY-MM-DD-HHmmss` (runtime-generated artifacts); added content validation: release files must contain both `## Release` and `## Retrospective`; evaluation files must carry a `**Status:**` field.
- **`lib/score-workflow.js`** — added evaluator verdict parsing (`APPROVED` / `APPROVED_WITH_NOTES` / `CHANGES_REQUIRED`), gate pass rate calculation, Iron Law compliance rate, and preamble line-count efficiency metric; output now includes a top-level `kpi` summary block.
- **`skills/self-improvement/SKILL.md.tmpl`** — ACTION items now carry a `Priority: P0/P1/P2` field; new **Phase 6.5 — Loop Back to Next Plan** explicitly carries forward unresolved P0/P1 actions from the prior improvement report to prevent silent drop.
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — removed deprecated `retros/` row from Document Output Convention (standalone retro files deprecated in v0.5.8; retrospective content now lives inside release artifacts).

---

## [0.5.8] — 2026-04-20

### Changed
- Skill consolidation review artifacts updated to final-state wording so historical review docs match the merged canonical skill model.
- Documentation cleanup continued for canonical naming consistency in active docs and review artifacts.

### Fixed
- Version metadata synchronized to `0.5.8` across package/runtime/plugin manifests (`package.json`, `claude-skill.json`, `.claude-plugin/*`, `lib/setup.js`, `hooks/session-start`).
- README synchronized with current stable version.

## [0.5.7] — 2026-04-20

### Added
- **RELEASE stage** — merged SHIP + REFLECT into a single `RELEASE` stage; pipeline is now 6 stages (THINK → PLAN → REVIEW → BUILD → VERIFY → RELEASE)
- New `skills/release/` skill with parallel Release + Retrospective output in one artifact (`docs/superomni/releases/`)
- New `/release` command registered in `claude-skill.json` and `commands/release.md`

### Fixed
- **Windows Git Bash compatibility** — replaced `stat -c %Y`/`stat -f %m` loop in `_session_files()` with cross-platform `find -newer` approach
- **Soft artifact skip removed** — `_verify_stage_artifact("SHIP") || true` eliminated; RELEASE now requires `release-*.md` artifact before auto-advancing
- **Spec approval gate** — `brainstorm` now writes `.approved-spec-*` marker on approval; `vibe` stage detection uses this to prevent auto-advancing past THINK without explicit user approval

### Changed
- `lib/preamble.md` compressed from 221 → 148 lines (−33%) by replacing verbose bash blocks with prose descriptions
- All 30 compiled `SKILL.md` files updated with new preamble and RELEASE pipeline references
- `CLAUDE.md` updated with 6-stage pipeline, `release` skill entry, and `docs/superomni/releases/` directory

---

## [0.5.4] — 2026-04-08

### Added
- **Plan Mode Fallback** — Added a "Plan Mode Fallback" section to the shared preamble (`lib/preamble.md`) and `using-skills/SKILL.md`. If Claude enters Plan Mode despite the routing rule, skills now take precedence: skill instructions are treated as executable steps, STOP points are respected, and planning output routes to `docs/superomni/plans/` instead of Claude's built-in plan file. Inspired by garrytan/gstack's "coexist with plan mode" approach.
- **Two-layer EnterPlanMode defense** — Layer 1 (CLAUDE.md + EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT): hard routing rule intercepts EnterPlanMode → brainstorm. Layer 2 (Plan Mode Fallback in all 29 skills): if already in plan mode, vibe workflow still governs.

### Changed
- **CLAUDE.md** — Upgraded "Planning route" soft guidance to "CRITICAL RULE — EnterPlanMode routes to brainstorm skill" with hard conditional language.
- **`using-skills/SKILL.md`** — `<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>` block changed from "feel the urge" soft redirect to "HARD ROUTING RULE: Do NOT call EnterPlanMode" with direct action instruction.
- **28 skill preambles rebuilt** — All templated skills regenerated to include Plan Mode Fallback section.

---

## [0.5.3] — 2026-04-07

### Changed
- **EnterPlanMode: prohibition → redirect** — Replaced "CRITICAL: No EnterPlanMode" prohibitions across all 27 skills, `using-skills`, `vibe`, and `CLAUDE.md` with a superpowers-inspired redirect pattern. Instead of telling the model "never use Plan Mode", the framework now intercepts the planning impulse and routes it to `brainstorm` or `writing-plans` skills via a decision flow graph.
- **`using-skills/SKILL.md`** — Added `<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>` tagged redirect block and dot-language flow graph (inspired by obra/superpowers) that intercepts "About to EnterPlanMode?" decision point.
- **`vibe/SKILL.md`** — Replaced "CRITICAL: Do NOT use EnterPlanMode" with "Planning Route" section listing skill alternatives per intent.
- **27 skill preambles** — `### CRITICAL: No EnterPlanMode` (3 lines) → `### Planning Route` (1-line redirect).

### Removed
- **PreToolUse hook** (`hooks/block-plan-mode`) — Removed the hook-based hard block approach in favor of the redirect pattern.
- **`.claude/settings.json`** — Removed project-level settings that registered the PreToolUse hook.
- **`hooks.json` PreToolUse entries** — Restored to SessionStart-only configuration.

---

## [0.5.1] — 2026-04

### Added
- **`/vibe` entry point skill** (`skills/vibe/SKILL.md`): Unified framework activation command that auto-detects the current pipeline stage (THINK→PLAN→BUILD→REVIEW→TEST→PROD-CHECK→SHIP→REFLECT) from existing artifacts and routes to the appropriate skill. Supports `/vibe`, `/vibe status`, and `/vibe reset` subcommands.
- **`[session]` identifier in file naming**: All generated documents now use the pattern `[type]-[branch]-[session]-[date].md` where `[session]` is a short kebab-case label auto-generated from conversation context (e.g., `vibe-skill`, `auth-refactor`). Enables agents to search and retrieve relevant prior sessions.

### Changed
- **Document output reorganization**: `spec.md` moved to `docs/superomni/specs/`, `plan.md` moved to `docs/superomni/plans/`. All generated artifacts now live in categorized subdirectories — no loose files in `docs/superomni/` root.
- **Self-improvement docs now user-facing**: Improvement reports, evaluation reports, and harness audit reports moved from `.superomni/` (internal) to `docs/superomni/` (user-facing). Agents can now index these for self-improvement across sessions.
- Updated all 50+ files with new document paths and naming conventions.

---

## [0.5.0] — 2026-04

### Changed
- **Installation redesign**: `npx github:Wilder1222/superomni` is now the primary project-level install method for all platforms (Claude, Codex, Copilot, Gemini). Global install via `npm install -g` + `superomni setup`.
- **Platform-specific instruction templates**: Each CLI gets tailored config files — `CLAUDE.md` (with slash commands), `AGENTS.md` (with trigger phrases + command file mapping for Codex), `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (with skill directory references for Copilot), `GEMINI.md`.
- **Document output paths**: User-facing outputs (spec, plan, reviews, executions, subagent sessions, production readiness) now write to `docs/superomni/`. Internal state (improvements, evaluations, harness audits) stays in `.superomni/`.
- Renamed `brainstorm` skill to `brainstorm` for consistency across the project.
- Renamed `scripts.build` to `scripts.gen-skills` to avoid triggering npm git dep preparation.
- CLI rewritten with explicit `install` (default, project-level) and `setup` (global) commands.

### Fixed
- Removed `scripts.postinstall` — it triggered npm 11's git dep preparation bug (npm/cli#8131), causing `npx` to fail silently.
- Added `--force` flag to overwrite existing installations.

### Added
- `lib/templates/claude-instructions.js` — Claude Code instruction generator
- `lib/templates/codex-instructions.js` — Codex CLI instruction generator (includes slash command → file mapping)
- `lib/templates/copilot-instructions.js` — GitHub Copilot instruction generator
- `install.sh` — curl-pipe-bash installer as fallback

---

## [0.4.1] — 2026-03

### Fixed
- `bin/superomni-cli`: Project-level `npx superomni` now correctly installs into the user's current working directory. When npm sets `INIT_CWD` (standard behaviour for `npx` invocations), the CLI binary now exports it as `SUPEROMNI_TARGET_DIR` before delegating to the setup script, mirroring the detection already present in `lib/postinstall.js`.
- `setup`: Corrected stale internal `VERSION` string from `0.3.0` to `0.4.1`.

---

## [0.4.0] — 2026-03

### Added
- `skills/harness-engineering/` — harness engineering audit skill; evaluates context efficiency, tool action space, evaluation gate coverage, and feedback loops; produces Harness Health Score (N/25) and prioritized improvement backlog to `docs/superomni/harness-audits/`. Inspired by OpenAI and Anthropic harness engineering best practices.
- `agents/evaluator.md` — dedicated evaluation agent; produces criterion-by-criterion APPROVED/CHANGES_REQUIRED verdicts with evidence backing. Based on Anthropic's principle: "Evaluation is the load-bearing part of agent harness design."
- `commands/harness-audit.md` — `/harness-audit` slash command; runs the full 8-phase harness audit
- `docs/HARNESS.md` — comprehensive harness engineering guide covering core principles, superomni harness architecture, and maintenance indicators

### Changed
- `skills/executing-plans/`: Added Iron Law 2 (Evaluate Before Advancing) and Iron Law 3 (Failures Are Harness Signals); added Phase 4 (Wave Evaluation Gate) between wave execution and mid-plan check-ins — waves must now pass an evaluation gate before advancing; phases renumbered 4→5, 5→6, 6→7
- `lib/preamble.md`: Added **Context Window Management** protocol (progressive disclosure table for all workflow stages) and **Feedback Signal Protocol** (1/2/3 failure escalation with harness signal trigger)
- `CLAUDE.md`: Registered `harness-engineering` skill (P1); added `/harness-audit` command; added harness-audits output directory to Document Output Convention
- `claude-skill.json`: Bumped to v0.4.0; registered `harness-audit` command
- `docs/DESIGN.md`: Updated to v0.4.0; added Section 9 (Design Decisions: v0.4.0) documenting harness engineering decisions

### Philosophy
v0.4.0 applies harness engineering principles directly to the superomni framework itself — treating the framework as the product and agent output as its artifact. The harness-engineering skill and evaluator agent close the quality loop that was previously informal.

---

- `using-skills` skill: added `self-improvement` to quick reference table
- `CLAUDE.md`: registered `self-improvement` skill with trigger phrases
- `docs/DESIGN.md`: updated version to 0.3.0
