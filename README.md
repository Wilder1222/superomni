# super-omni

> **Plan Lean, Execute Complete** — A fused AI coding skill framework for Claude Code.

super-omni combines the best ideas from [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) (methodology-driven AI skill framework) and [garrytan/gstack](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack) (engineering completeness principles) into a unified, opinionated system for AI-assisted software development.

---

## What Is This?

super-omni is a collection of **skills** — structured behavior specifications for AI coding assistants. Each skill tells Claude Code exactly how to handle a specific type of work: brainstorming, planning, debugging, testing, reviewing, shipping.

The framework is built on one core philosophy:

> **Plan with YAGNI. Execute with completeness.**

Plan only what you need. But what you decide to build — build it fully.

---

## Quick Start

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Wilder1222/super-omni.git ~/.claude/skills/super-omni
cd ~/.claude/skills/super-omni
./setup
```

### Use in Claude Code

Open your project in Claude Code. Skills activate automatically via session hooks.

Start with:
- `/brainstorm` — design a feature from scratch
- `/write-plan` — turn an idea into an executable plan
- `/execute-plan` — run the plan step by step
- `/retro` — weekly engineering retrospective

## Skills Reference

### Core Workflow (P0)

| Skill | When to Use | Key Output |
|-------|------------|------------|
| `using-skills` | Always active | Loads the framework |
| `brainstorming` | New feature/design | `spec.md` |
| `writing-plans` | Planning implementation | `plan.md` |
| `executing-plans` | Running a plan | Code changes + report |
| `systematic-debugging` | Any bug/error | Debug report + fix |

### Quality Assurance (P1)

| Skill | When to Use | Key Output |
|-------|------------|------------|
| `test-driven-development` | Writing code | Tests + implementation |
| `verification` | Before claiming done | Verification report |
| `code-review` | Reviewing code/PRs | Structured review |
| `plan-review` | Before executing a plan | Reviewed plan |
| `subagent-development` | Complex parallel tasks | Multi-agent output |

### Advanced (P2)

| Skill | When to Use | Key Output |
|-------|------------|------------|
| `git-worktrees` | Multiple branches | Worktree setup |
| `finishing-branch` | Merging a branch | Clean PR |
| `dispatching-parallel` | Independent parallel tasks | Coordinated output |
| `investigate` | Exploring unfamiliar code | Investigation report |
| `retro` | Weekly review | Retrospective report |
| `ship` | Releasing software | Release + changelog |
| `writing-skills` | Creating new skills | New skill file |

## Configuration

```bash
# Check current config
bin/config list

# Disable auto-skill triggers (manual mode)
bin/config set proactive false

# Re-enable auto triggers
bin/config set proactive true

# Disable local telemetry
bin/config set telemetry false
```

Config is stored at `~/.omni-skills/config`. Telemetry is **local only** — nothing is sent to external servers.

## Philosophy

### The 6 Decision Principles

When making technical decisions, apply in context:

1. **Choose completeness** — cover more edge cases
2. **Boil lakes** — fix everything in blast radius if <1 day effort
3. **Pragmatic** — two equal options? Pick the cleaner one
4. **DRY** — duplicates existing? Reject. Reuse what exists.
5. **Explicit over clever** — 10-line obvious > 200-line abstraction
6. **Bias toward action** — flag concerns but don't block

### Status Protocol

Every skill session ends with one of:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `DONE` | All steps complete. Evidence provided. |
| `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS` | Complete, but issues noted. |
| `BLOCKED` | Cannot proceed. State what blocks you. |
| `NEEDS_CONTEXT` | Missing info. State exactly what you need. |

### PROACTIVE Mode

- `proactive=true` (default): Skills auto-activate when triggers are detected
- `proactive=false`: Skills only run when explicitly invoked. Agent says: *"I think [skill] might help — want me to run it?"*

## Design Documents

- [`ETHOS.md`](ETHOS.md) — Core philosophy: Plan Lean, Execute Complete
- [`docs/DESIGN.md`](docs/DESIGN.md) — Architectural design and fusion strategy
- [`docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md`](docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md) — Implementation details and development guide

## Development

### Building Skills from Templates

Skills use `{{PREAMBLE}}` as a macro that gets expanded during build:

```bash
# Build all skills
npm run build
# or
bash lib/gen-skill-docs.sh

# Build a single skill
bash lib/gen-skill-docs.sh skills/systematic-debugging/SKILL.md.tmpl
```

### Adding a New Skill

```bash
# Use the meta-skill!
# In Claude Code:
/brainstorm a new skill for [your use case]
```

Or manually:
1. Create `skills/<name>/SKILL.md.tmpl` (see `writing-skills` skill)
2. Run `bash lib/gen-skill-docs.sh`
3. Add to `CLAUDE.md` skills table
