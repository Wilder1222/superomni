# superomni

> **Plan Lean, Execute Complete** — A fused AI coding skill framework for Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Gemini CLI, and OpenCode.

superomni combines the best ideas from [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) (methodology-driven AI skill framework) and [garrytan/gstack](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack) (engineering completeness principles) into a unified, opinionated system for AI-assisted software development.

---

## What Is This?

superomni is a collection of **skills** — structured behavior specifications for AI coding assistants. Each skill tells Claude Code exactly how to handle a specific type of work: brainstorming, planning, debugging, testing, reviewing, shipping.

The framework is built on one core philosophy:

> **Plan with YAGNI. Execute with completeness.**

Plan only what you need. But what you decide to build — build it fully.

---

## Quick Start

### Install

---

**① Claude Code — marketplace install (recommended):**

Inside a Claude Code session, register and install the skill from GitHub:

```
/plugin marketplace add Wilder1222/superomni
```

Claude Code will fetch the `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` manifest, install all skills, register slash commands, and set up session hooks automatically.

Then start with:

```
/vibe
```

---

**② Other IDEs & CLIs — npm global install:**

For **Cursor**, **VS Code (Cline/Continue.dev)**, **JetBrains AI Assistant**, **Codex**, **Gemini CLI**, and **OpenCode**:

```bash
npm install -g github:Wilder1222/superomni
```

The `postinstall` hook auto-detects your platform and links skills, commands, and hooks automatically.

---

**③ Project-level install (no global install):**

```bash
npx github:Wilder1222/superomni
```

Runs the same auto-detection and linking as the global install, without installing anything permanently.

---

### Use in Claude Code

Open your project in Claude Code. Skills activate automatically via session hooks.

Start with:
- `/vibe` — **activate the full framework** and launch the guided default workflow
- `/brainstorm` — design a feature from scratch
- `/write-plan` — turn an idea into an executable plan
- `/execute-plan` — run the plan step by step
- `/review` — structured code review

---

### Managing Agents

```bash
# List all available agents
bin/agent-manager list

# Get details about an agent
bin/agent-manager info debugger

# Install an agent from GitHub
bin/agent-manager install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/user/repo/main/agents/my-agent.md

# Install from a local file
bin/agent-manager install ./my-custom-agent.md

# Create a new custom agent (interactive scaffold)
bin/agent-manager create my-specialist

# Remove a user-installed agent
bin/agent-manager remove my-specialist
```

See [`docs/AGENTS.md`](docs/AGENTS.md) for the full agent library reference.

## Multi-Platform Support

superomni supports multiple AI coding platforms:

| Platform | Status | Setup |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Claude Code** | ✅ Full support | Auto-detected by `./setup` |
| **Cursor** | ✅ Full support | Auto-detected by `./setup` |
| **Codex** | ✅ Full support | Auto-detected by `./setup` |
| **Gemini CLI** | ✅ Full support | Auto-detected by `./setup` |
| **OpenCode** | ✅ Full support | Auto-detected by `./setup` |
| **VS Code (Cline)** | ✅ Full support | Auto-detected by `./setup` |
| **VS Code (Continue.dev)** | ✅ Full support | Auto-detected by `./setup` |
| **JetBrains AI Assistant** | ✅ Full support | Auto-detected by `./setup` |

The setup script detects your platform and configures hooks, skills injection, and session management accordingly.

---

## Configuration

```bash
# Check current config
bin/config list

# Disable auto-skill triggers (manual mode)
bin/config set proactive false

# Re-enable auto triggers
bin/config set proactive true

# Disable local telemetry
bin/config set telemetry false
```

Config is stored at `~/.omni-skills/config`. Telemetry is **local only** — nothing is sent to external servers.

---

## Philosophy

### The 6 Decision Principles

When making technical decisions, apply in context:

1. **Choose completeness** — cover more edge cases
2. **Boil lakes** — fix everything in blast radius if <1 day effort
3. **Pragmatic** — two equal options? Pick the cleaner one
4. **DRY** — duplicates existing? Reject. Reuse what exists.
5. **Explicit over clever** — 10-line obvious > 200-line abstraction
6. **Bias toward action** — flag concerns but don't block

### Status Protocol

Every skill session ends with one of:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `DONE` | All steps complete. Evidence provided. |
| `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS` | Complete, but issues noted. |
| `BLOCKED` | Cannot proceed. State what blocks you. |
| `NEEDS_CONTEXT` | Missing info. State exactly what you need. |

### PROACTIVE Mode

- `proactive=true` (default): Skills auto-activate when triggers are detected
- `proactive=false`: Skills only run when explicitly invoked. Agent says: *"I think [skill] might help — want me to run it?"*

## Development

### Building Skills from Templates

23 skills use `{{PREAMBLE}}` as a macro that gets expanded during build:

```bash
# Build all skills
npm run build
# or
bash lib/gen-skill-docs.sh

# Build a single skill
bash lib/gen-skill-docs.sh skills/systematic-debugging/SKILL.md.tmpl
```

### Adding a New Skill

```bash
# Use the meta-skill!
# In Claude Code:
/brainstorm a new skill for [your use case]
```

Or manually:
1. Create `skills/<name>/SKILL.md.tmpl` (see `writing-skills` skill)
2. Run `bash lib/gen-skill-docs.sh`
3. Add to `CLAUDE.md` skills table
