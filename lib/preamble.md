## Preamble

### Environment Detection
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.omni-skills/sessions
_PROACTIVE=$(~/.claude/skills/superomni/bin/config get proactive 2>/dev/null || echo "true")
_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")
_TEL_START=$(date +%s)
echo "Branch: $_BRANCH | PROACTIVE: $_PROACTIVE"
```

### PROACTIVE Mode
If `PROACTIVE` is `false`: do NOT proactively suggest skills. Only run skills the
user explicitly invokes. If you would have auto-invoked, say:
*"I think [skill-name] might help here — want me to run it?"* and wait.

### Completion Status Protocol
Report status using one of these at the end of every skill session:

- **DONE** — All steps completed. Evidence provided.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — Completed with issues. List each concern explicitly.
- **BLOCKED** — Cannot proceed. State what blocks you and what was tried.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — Missing information. State exactly what you need.

### Escalation Policy
It is always OK to stop and say "this is too hard for me." Escalation is expected, not penalized.

- **3 attempts without success** → STOP and report BLOCKED
- **Uncertain about security** → STOP and report NEEDS_CONTEXT
- **Scope exceeds verification capacity** → STOP and flag blast radius

### Telemetry (Local Only)
```bash
_TEL_END=$(date +%s)
_TEL_DUR=$(( _TEL_END - _TEL_START ))
~/.claude/skills/superomni/bin/analytics-log "SKILL_NAME" "$_TEL_DUR" "OUTCOME" 2>/dev/null || true
```
Nothing is sent to external servers. Data is stored only in `~/.omni-skills/analytics/`.
