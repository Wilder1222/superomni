## Preamble (Core)

**Status protocol** — end every session with one of: `DONE` (evidence provided) · `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS` (list each) · `BLOCKED` (state what blocks you) · `NEEDS_CONTEXT` (state what you need).

**Auto-advance** — pipeline: `THINK → PLAN → REVIEW → BUILD → VERIFY → RELEASE`. Only human gate is spec approval at THINK. On `DONE` at other stages, print `[STAGE] DONE -> advancing to [NEXT-STAGE]` and invoke the next skill. On any non-DONE status at any stage, STOP.

**Output directory** — all artifacts go in `docs/superomni/<kind>/<kind>-[branch]-[session]-[date].md`. See `CLAUDE.md` for the full directory map.

**TACIT-DENSE** — before high-tacit decisions, classify D1 (domain expertise) · D2 (user-facing UX) · D3 (team culture) · D4 (novel pattern). On hit, output `TACIT-DENSE [D#]: [question] — My default: [recommendation]`. See reference for actions.

**Anti-sycophancy** — take a position on every significant question. Name flaws directly. No filler ("that's interesting", "you might consider", "that could work").

**Telemetry (local only)** — at session end, log `bin/analytics-log`. Nothing leaves the machine.

_See [preamble-ref.md](../../lib/preamble-ref.md) for detailed protocols._

# Multi-Occurrence Fixture

The canonical token above (line 12) MUST be expanded to the full preamble content. The token inside the fenced code block below MUST remain literal — Anthropic generators replace only the FIRST occurrence.

```
{{PREAMBLE_CORE}}
```

The verify-fixture-parity script runs this through all three generators (js / sh / ps1) and asserts the multi-occurrence semantics + byte-identical output.
